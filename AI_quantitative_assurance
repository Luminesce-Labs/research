Summary

This work introduces a unified information-theoretic framework that provides provable, end-to-end guarantees for AI behaviour across distributed data and model pipelines. The approach uses:
	•	Entropy budgets
	•	Correlation bounds
	•	A structured Verification–Safety–Recovery (VSR) architecture

The goal is to ensure that industrial AI systems behave predictably and safely under real-world operational constraints, including adversarial inputs, data drift, and distributed inconsistencies.

Problem Addressed

Modern, production-grade AI systems lack formal guarantees regarding:
	•	Propagation and accumulation of uncertainty across multi-stage pipelines
	•	Information loss, drift, and collapse in data quality
	•	Hallucination amplification under load, distribution shift, or adversarial scenarios
	•	Inconsistencies across distributed deployments (multi-region, multi-tenant, cross-jurisdiction)
	•	Missing compositional certification for complex DAG-shaped pipelines

Existing observability and MLOps tools are reactive: they detect failures after degradation occurs.
This framework provides preventative, mathematically grounded guarantees over behaviour, safety, and information quality.

Approach

1. Entropy-Bounded Data Pipelines (EBDP)

A formalism that applies quantitative entropy and information-quality constraints to every pipeline stage.
Each stage exposes a verifiable contract governing:
	•	Allowed entropy budget
	•	Permissible uncertainty
	•	Expected information throughput
	•	Tolerances for drift, compression, and transformation

2. Entropy-Frugal Intelligence (EFI)

A modelling approach that ensures inference components operate within controlled entropy and correlation budgets, preventing:
	•	Overconfident outputs
	•	Information-destructive transformations
	•	Inference instability under stress

3. Verification–Safety–Recovery (VSR)

A system-level architecture describing transitions between:
	•	Verified / nominal operation
	•	Degraded or safe-mode operation
	•	Controlled recovery with full auditability

VSR defines formal safety envelopes and ensures failures remain bounded, predictable, and reversible.

Architectural Properties

The framework supports arbitrary directed acyclic graph (DAG) pipelines, including:
	•	Parallel branches
	•	Merge points
	•	Skip connections
	•	Multi-modal processing chains
	•	Multi-region distributed pipelines

Each component exposes a contract, and contracts compose algebraically.
This enables system-level guarantees to be derived from independently verified parts.

Target Applications

This framework applies to high-assurance AI domains, including:
	•	Autonomous driving and robotics (ISO 26262)
	•	Medical AI and clinical decision support (IEC 62304)
	•	Aviation / avionics systems (DO-178C / DO-254)
	•	AI security, SOC automation, cybersecurity analytics
	•	Agentic AI governance, alignment, and oversight
	•	Financial model risk management (e.g., SR 11-7)
	•	Telecom and multi-region data pipelines (NIS2 compliance)
	•	Industrial automation, manufacturing, critical infrastructure
