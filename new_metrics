### Summary

IS and CMRI are quantitative metrics for assessing independence and correlated risk between models,
components, or security controls, providing a rigorous foundation for independence-aware design.

### Problem Addressed

Many architectures implicitly assume:

- Model ensembles provide diversity  
- Multiple vendors ensure independence  
- Layering security components reduces risk

However, without formal metrics, correlated failure modes remain hidden and can cause systemic collapse
or multi-layer compromise.

### Approach

The work defines:

- **Independence Score (IS)** — an aggregate scalar in [0, 1] that measures the degree of independence
  between two components along structural, informational, and operational axes.
- **Cross-Model Risk Index (CMRI)** — a measure of correlated risk that incorporates output correlation,
  shared data, common failure modes, and error propagation dynamics.

The metrics are designed to be computed from observable attributes and can be used in architecture reviews,
tooling, and automated assessments.

### Key Contributions (Novel)

- First formal independence metrics explicitly tailored for AI and cyber systems  
- Unification of correlation, entropy overlap, and dependency analysis into IS/CMRI  
- Practical bridge between high-level independence theory (CFS) and concrete system scoring  
- Reusable scoring scheme for ensembles, multi-agent systems, and multi-vendor stacks

### Target Applications

- AI risk and model governance assessments  
- Ensemble model evaluation and selection  
- Design reviews for SOC, SIEM, and cyber defence architectures  
- Safety and compliance preparation (e.g. ISO 26262, NIS2)  
- Automated evaluation in AxoDen and CyberIntelX tools
