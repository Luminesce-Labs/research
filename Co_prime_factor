Summary

Coprime-Factor Security (CFS) introduces a quantitative, independence-oriented defence-in-depth model that prevents correlated failures across security layers.
It does so by engineering structural, informational, and operational coprimeness across systems, vendors, and AI components.

CFS provides a mathematically grounded way to reason about independence, detect latent coupling, and build architectures that remain resilient even when individual subsystems fail.

Problem Addressed

Enterprise and AI-driven security architectures typically assume that controls are independent.
In practice, they are not.

Correlations frequently arise from:
	•	Shared telemetry and data sources
	•	Shared model biases and training sets
	•	ML pipeline coupling
	•	Platform monoculture
	•	Vendor lock-in
	•	Identical or mirrored detection logic
	•	Hidden dependencies across layers

These correlations lead to systemic failure modes, including:
	•	Compound breaches
	•	Cross-layer poisoning
	•	Lateral model hallucination propagation
	•	Log/telemetry cascades
	•	Multi-stage compromise chains

Traditional security frameworks do not quantify independence and offer no formal method to prevent correlated collapse.

CFS directly solves this problem.

⸻

Approach

CFS defines an independence-centric security architecture built on:

Coprime Factors

Three orthogonal dimensions:
	•	Structural (platform, vendor, runtime, language, execution substrate)
	•	Informational (data sources, feature sets, context windows, training regimes)
	•	Operational (timing, failure modes, detection logic, adversarial surfaces)

Independence Score (IS)

A quantitative measure of how independent two or more components truly are.

Cross-Model Risk Index (CMRI)

A correlation-aware index estimating the probability of joint failure under shared stressors.

ρ-Bounded Trust Correlation

A formal bound ensuring ρ ≤ ε, preventing unacceptable cross-layer coupling.

Multi-Root Attestation

An extension of safety-inspired multi-root trust architecture (compatible with ASIL-M) to ensure no single compromise can invalidate the entire security stack.

Entropy & Heterogeneity Budgets

Controls that ensure diversity-of-failure, preventing attack paths enabled by monoculture or uniform model behaviour.

⸻

Architectural Insight

Each security control is expressed as a coprime-factor decomposition, analogous to prime factorisation:

If two layers share no coprime factors, they cannot fail in a correlated way.

This enables the construction of provably non-correlated detection and prevention architectures.

CFS supports:
	•	Independence-engineered defence-in-depth
	•	Cross-domain trust modelling
	•	Detection of latent coupling across pipelines
	•	Mathematical enforcement of independence guarantees
