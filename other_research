## 1. Correlation Composites for Attack Chains

A pattern for detecting and scoring multi-stage attack chains by correlating events and findings along
dimensions such as:

- Temporal ordering  
- Technique and tactic sequences  
- Lateral movement and privilege escalation  
- Data staging and exfiltration

This approach links naturally to independence-aware architectures, as it exposes correlated behaviour
even when local checks appear clean.

## 2. Semantic-Preserving Context Transitions

A structured method for changing topics or shifting context while preserving essential information and
minimising semantic loss. It typically involves:

- Extracting essential information  
- Building a semantic summary  
- Introducing an explicit transition bridge  
- Acknowledging the shift  
- Verifying fidelity via metrics

This is applicable to conversational systems, collaborative tools, and any system that must maintain coherent context across transitions.

## 3. AI-to-AI Coaching Protocol

A protocol where AI agents coach other AI agents in methodology selection, instruction design, or
strategy refinement. The approach involves:

- Agent profiling and capability assessment  
- Matching agents to methodologies and tools  
- Generating instructions and evaluating outcomes  
- Using feedback to improve future selections

This has been shown (in internal evaluations) to significantly reduce suboptimal choices and accelerate
deployment of complex configurations.

## 4. Nine-Dimensional Coherence Monitoring

A context-drift and coherence monitoring method that tracks multiple dimensions of an interaction or
session, such as semantic alignment, intent, goals, narrative continuity, emotional tone, momentum,
pattern stability, honesty, and coding standards. It is designed to:

- Detect drift and incoherence early  
- Warn or intervene when quality degrades  
- Provide metrics for conversational or log-stream integrity

The method is relevant for long-horizon agentic systems and for high-stakes interactive use cases.

## 5. Ensemble ML with Explicit Uncertainty

An architecture that combines multiple model types (e.g., sequence models, transformers, and Bayesian
components) and explicitly quantifies uncertainty via techniques such as Monte Carlo dropout and
ensemble variance, with:

- Dynamic re-weighting based on historical performance  
- Integration into confidence and risk scoring pipelines  
- Support for downstream decision logic in security and safety contexts

---

## 6. Adaptive Confidence Scoring

A multi-factor confidence model which combines dimensions such as finding quality, indicator richness,
temporal consistency, correlation strength, and contextual boosts. It is designed so that:

- Weights can be tuned based on observed false positive/false negative characteristics  
- Uncertainty can be propagated to downstream components  
- Scoring is robust under varying data quality

This work is especially relevant for CyberIntelX and related security analytics engines.

## 7. Evidence-Weighted Vulnerability Scoring

An approach that combines multiple vulnerability-related signals such as traditional CVSS metrics,
exploit prediction scores, and known exploited vulnerability flags into a single evidence-weighted
score. This provides:

- A more realistic sense of exploitability and impact  
- Prioritisation logic for patching and mitigation workflows  
- Better integration with empirical threat intelligence

It fits naturally into CFS-aligned security architectures.

## 8. Circuit Breakers for External Dependencies

A general pattern for guarding AI systems and security pipelines against external dependency failures,
featuring:

- Failure thresholds and backoff logic  
- Graceful degradation modes (e.g., cached or default responses)  
- Monitoring and alerting on dependency health

This pattern supports robust integration of AxoDen components, threat intelligence feeds, and external
APIs without destabilising core systems.

## 9. Living Intelligence Transformation and Methodology Architectures

Innovations around:

- Treating methodology collections as dynamic, evolving knowledge bases  
- Using transformation matrices to update knowledge over time  
- Structuring systems into collection, processing, and interface layers  
- Benchmarking methods against external frameworks

These ideas strengthen METIS and any system that aims to maintain a rapidly evolving, high-quality
methodology library.
